## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

In this project I practiced JavaScript Functionality like using event listeners to handle buttons clicks and update the DOM, and handling dynamic content updates, such as displaying the selected rating.

In this project I learned Modal Dialog Management, understanding the <dialog> element and its atributes, controling the modal's visibility with .showModal() metod and managing modal behavior, like closing it when clicking outside od it.


### Continued development

I definitley have more to learn in JavaScript
